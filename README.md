# Philosophers | 42Paris
Eat, Sleep, Spaghetti, repeat. This project is about learning how threads work by precisely timing a group of philosophers on when to pick up forks and eat spaghetti without dying from hunger.
This project is a training to multi-threads programming with the use of mutex. 

# Rules:
- One or more philosophers sit at a round table. There is a large bowl of spaghetti in the middle of the table.
- The philosophers alternatively eat, think, or sleep. While they are eating, they are not thinking nor sleeping; while thinking, they are not eating nor sleeping;
and, of course, while sleeping, they are not eating nor thinking.
- There are also forks on the table. There are as many forks as philosophers.
- Because serving and eating spaghetti with only one fork is very inconvenient, a philosopher takes their right and their left forks to eat, one in each hand.
- When a philosopher has finished eating, they put their forks back on the table and start sleeping. Once awake, they start thinking again. The simulation stops when a philosopher dies of starvation.
- Every philosopher needs to eat and should never starve.
- No need to say that philosophers should avoid dying!
- A message announcing a philosopher died should be displayed no more than 10 ms after the actual death of the philosopher.
  
# Usage
- git clone https://github.com/shimazadeh/Philosophers.git Philosopher
- cd Philosopher/Philo
- make
- to run the program: ./philo number_of_philosophers time_to_die time_to_eat time_to_sleep [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]
  - time_to_die (in milliseconds): If a philosopher didnâ€™t start eating time_to_die milliseconds since the beginning of their last meal or the beginning of the simulation, they die.
  - time_to_eat (in milliseconds): The time it takes for a philosopher to eat. During that time, they will need to hold two forks.
  - time_to_sleep (in milliseconds): The time a philosopher will spend sleeping.
  - number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat (optional argument): If all philosophers have eaten at least number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat times, the simulation stops. If not specified, the simulation stops when a philosopher dies.
- The program produces logs while its running as follows:
  - timestamp_in_ms X has taken a fork
  - timestamp_in_ms X is eating
  - timestamp_in_ms X is sleeping
  - timestamp_in_ms X is thinking
  - timestamp_in_ms X died
** Note: X is the philosopher number.
